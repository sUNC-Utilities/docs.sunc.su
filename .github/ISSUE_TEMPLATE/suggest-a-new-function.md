# Function Suggestion

<!-- Thank you for suggesting a new function for the sUNC standard.  
Please fill out **all** sections below as thoroughly as possible.

--- -->

## 1. Existing functionality check

<!-- Have you considered whether the functionality you are requesting can already be achieved within Luau using existing functions? -->

- [ ] Yes, I have checked existing functions.
- [ ] No, I have not checked existing functions.

<!-- 
If **yes**, please explain why any current methods are inefficient or unsatisfactory.  

For instance, is the desired functionality currently **too complex**, **inefficient**, or **inaccessible** due to requiring multiple unrelated functions?

If **no**, please alternatively check the [sUNC Documentation](https://docs.sunc.su) for potentially related functions to see if you can achieve your goal, instead of posting a new issue. -->

## 2. Rationale

At the bare minimum, what would you expect from a function that aims to resolve the complexities you described above?

> **Expected outcome or behaviour:**
