**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

- have you considered whether the functionality you are requesting can already be done from within lua with the existing MULTITUDE of functions?
- if yes, but still believe it should be separate, then please explain why there should be a separate function (eg due to complexities in using multiple different existing functions for something that theoretically should be simple and accessible)

- hence or otherwise, at the bare minimum, what would you expect from a function which seeks to resolve the aforementioned complexities (if any) above?

hence:
- name of function
- what should this function do
- please provide (an) example use case(s) where this function may be useful, listing not just only your specific use case but any other use cases where you might think it may also be applicable for other people
