# Closures

The **Closures** library enables the inspection, modification and creation of Luau closures with precise control.

It is one of the most powerful tools available, exposing internals in a way that Luau does not natively support out of the box.

This library is incredibly useful for hooking functions to modify game logic to your own advantage, and any other creative uses you can think of.

## What is a closure?

The term [*"closure"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) comes from [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and refers to a function ***plus*** the environment it carries (its **upvalues**).

In Luau, **every function is implemented as a closure** implicitly, even if it doesn't capture anything.

## What can you do?

With the Closures library, you can:

- **Hook** existing functions or metamethods with [`#!luau hookfunction`](./hookfunction.md) and [`#!luau hookmetamethod`](./hookmetamethod.md)
- **Check** whether the current execution is from your script using [`#!luau checkcaller`](./checkcaller.md) for **hooking**
- **Clone** a function while keeping the same behavior to avoid tampering, with [`#!luau clonefunction`](./clonefunction.md)
- **Wrap** a Luau closure into a C closure using [`#!luau newcclosure`](./newcclosure.md)
- **Check** a function's closure type with [`#!luau iscclosure`](./iscclosure.md), [`#!luau islclosure`](./islclosure.md) or [`#!luau isexecutorclosure`](./isexecutorclosure.md).
- **Hash** a function with [`#!luau getfunctionhash`](./getfunctionhash.md)

## What can't you do?

Although closure capabilities are powerful, there are natural boundaries:

- You cannot inspect **true C closures' internals** - they are not Luau-defined, compiled, and therefore opaque by design.
- Attempting to implement [`#!luau newcclosure`](./newcclosure.md) in Luau (e.g. via [`#!luau coroutine.wrap`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/libraries/coroutine#wrap)) **will fail sUNC verification**.
