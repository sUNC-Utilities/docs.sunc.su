# sUNC Integration Suite

!!! info "This integration suite is not related to the functions outlined in the rest of the documentation; this is a **WEB DEVELOPMENT** thing."

The **sUNC Integration Suite** provides a set of external-facing tools and APIs that allow developers to embed sUNC into their own websites, dashboards, or infrastructure.

This suite is especially useful for web developers who work on status websites, people who want to show off their test score on their exploit website, or forums where embedding is allowed.

## What can you do?

With the sUNC Integration Suite, you can:

- **Embed** rich test result viewers into your site using the [**widget system**](./Widget)
- **Fetch** live, structured function metadata using the [**sUNC Metadata API**](./Metadata-API/)
- **Query** test result data from our upcoming Results API
